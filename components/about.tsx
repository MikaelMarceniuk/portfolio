              I specialize in building end-to-end web applications using
              cutting-edge technologies like React, Next.js, NestJS, and
              TypeScript. My approach combines clean, maintainable code with
              performance optimization, resulting in applications that scale
              efficiently and deliver exceptional user experiences.

              I've helped startups reduce deployment time by 60% and enterprises
              improve application performance by 40% through strategic
              architecture decisions and modern development practices.

              Currently, I'm a Senior Full-Stack Developer specializing in
              accessibility and performance optimization. I contribute to the
              creation and maintenance of scalable applications that meet modern
              web standards and best practices to deliver inclusive user
              experiences.

              When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new coffee brewing
              techniques â€“ precision matters in both code and coffee.
